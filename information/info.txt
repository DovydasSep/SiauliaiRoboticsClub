<h2>Mini Sumo</h2>
<p>Mini sumo robot It measures 10cm x 10cm. Weight - about 450gr. 
It uses a polyol 50: 1 n20 motors, a nano-tech 300mAh 2-cell battery,
 a robot "brain" by Nerijus Ramanauskas designed pcb board incorporating
 an Arduino nano microcontroller, a tb3316fng motor controller, a starter
 module (also designed by Nerijus Ramanauskas Sh) 340k distance sensor and
 two tcrt1000 line sensors. Rims printed with 3D printer are covered with
 silicone (silicon from silikon.lt). The construction of the robot is made
 of PLA plastic. Not only does the robot have a start module, which not
 only allows you to start and stop the robot using the remote control,
 but also allows you to select various combat tactics. The front of the
 robot is molded from lead and the bottom is cut from a 3mm iron sheet.</p>


<h2>Line following</h2>
<p>Line tracking robot with turbine. Its size is 21cm x 23cm.
 Weight - about 120gr. It uses 10: 1 n20 engines, a nano-tech
 300mAh 2-cell battery. The robot pcb plate was drawn using the
 Eagle program and commissioned from jlcpcb.com. Plate-mounted
 atmega 328p, two tb6612fng motor controllers, 5v 3A voltage
 regulator, 30mm turbine (EDF) controlled by 20A speed regulator
 from hobbyking.com. Eight QRE1113GR sensors are used to detect
 the line. The robot program is written using the Arduio IDE
 environment, the program uses a PID algorithm for more accurate
 line tracking. Rims and engine mounts are printed with a 3D 
printer made of PLA plastic. Tires on the wheels from the mini-Z
 machine. The bluetooth HC-06 module connects to the robot so the
 robot's travel settings can be changed from the phone.</p>
